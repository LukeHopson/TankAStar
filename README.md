# TankAStar
A* Search prototype in Unity. This project uses a world decomposer to create a grid of valid and invalid positions, then uses an A* algorithm for enemy tank pathfinding. View [EnemyAStar.cs](Assets/Scripts/EnemyAStar.cs) and [WorldDecomposer.cs](Assets/Scripts/WorldDecomposer.cs) to copy the algorithm.
